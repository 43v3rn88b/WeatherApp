# WeatherApp

This is basically a fork from https://github.com/AakashBedi01/WeatherApp, but I've changed a lot of code to suit the requirements for the assignment and decided to share this to anyone who struggles with similar assignment.

### Some of the changes

1. There is now a background image that will change (not dynamically) for different times of the day (morning, noon, afternoon, evening) like in this example:
   
   <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c04c1723-2874-42b1-8848-af5a0e72899b" width="500">
   
2. Instead of 3 day forecast I implement hourly forecast.
3. You can also choose what units to use in temperature like celsius or fahrenheit and mph or kph in wind speed.
4. There is also a search history that will record successfull weather search.
5. And javadoc comments :)
   
### Things that needs improvement in the future

1. Since I remove the autocomplete feature because it keeps removing the location when I click it (I don't know why currently, why it do this). You won't be able to see other cities with similar names like Paris, france & paris, texas. It will do this probably automatically.
2. Implement animated icons, graphs, or better UI.
3. Make background change dynamically.
4. Include more detailed weather information, such as precipitation probability.
5. Other things like performance, code design practices, etc.
